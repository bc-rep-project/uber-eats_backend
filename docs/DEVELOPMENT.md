## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branches from `develop`
2. Use conventional commits:
   - feat: New features
   - fix: Bug fixes
   - docs: Documentation changes
   - style: Code style changes
   - refactor: Code refactoring
   - test: Test updates
   - chore: Maintenance tasks

### Code Style
- Python: Follow PEP 8
- TypeScript: Follow Airbnb style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Write unit tests for new features

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Maintain 80%+ code coverage

### Documentation Requirements
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Add JSDoc comments for TypeScript functions
- Update README for major changes
- Document configuration changes

## Environment Setup

### Required Software
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- MongoDB 5+
- Git

### Development Tools
- VS Code or PyCharm
- MongoDB Compass
- Postman
- React Developer Tools

## Deployment

### Staging Environment
- Backend: Render.com
- Frontend: Vercel
- Database: MongoDB Atlas

### Production Environment
- Backend: Render.com
- Frontend: Vercel

- CDN: Cloudflare

## Notes and Decisions

### Technical Decisions
1. Using Flask for backend due to:
   - Lightweight and flexible
   - Easy to scale
   - Rich ecosystem
   - Simple to maintain

2. Using React TypeScript for frontend due to:
   - Type safety
   - Better developer experience
   - Rich component ecosystem
   - Strong community support

3. Using MongoDB for database due to:
   - Flexible schema
   - Scalability
   - Good performance for read-heavy operations
   - Native geospatial queries support

### Known Issues
- None currently

### Security Considerations
- Implement rate limiting
- Use secure headers
- Sanitize user inputs
- Implement CSRF protection
- Regular dependency updates
- Secure password storage
- API key rotation
